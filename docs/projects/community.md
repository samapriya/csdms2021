# Community Datasets

This is one step beyond archiving data on a personal website or within a data center as mandated by many funding agencies. For example: You should still start by having a DOI associated with the data either by publishing it as a part of a peer-reviewed paper or by using a service like Zenodo. Then, regardless of where you created your final product, you would upload your dataset details into our digital commons list and citations are included.

Even if you arenâ€™t the dataset author, you can still suggest products because you are using them within your project. Creating shared cloud-based assets saves everyone time and effort. Examples of this include basic information on shorelines and rivers. Many projects use simplistic information on shorelines or duplicate efforts by uploading their own version of river centerlines and extent. Using data which has been systematically generated globally has major benefits, especially if it was derived using modern techniques. This improves the quality of our science.
