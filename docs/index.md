* Once you have a Google Earth Engine account click [this link](https://samapriya.github.io/csdms2021/projects/labs_ee/) and add find how to add the clinic repository to your account.

#### Google Earth Engine <small>Browser Based Remote Sensing</small>
I like to tell people that Google Earth Engine does browser based remote sensing , because all you need is an active internet connection and a browser to run this. To bring us to a fair playing field when it comes to analyzing and repeating data analysis. Google Earth Engine is a cloud based analysis platform that allows for an indexable and queryable raster and vector environment while including and expanding on raster capabilities. It allows for users to perform large scale analysis on multiple assets a large number of which it actively ingests and maintains. While maintaining one of the world's largest repository of open source and distributable datasets, it allows you to scale and fit analysis based on your needs from local to global analysis. The analysis is performed using a JavaScript or python environment depending on the need and the results are repeatable and shareable as research outputs.
